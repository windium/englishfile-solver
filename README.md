on my prep school year we used english file as our main book and teacher gave online practices for holiday homework so I had to do it all as fast as I could, lastly I found the solution to make this done :D

ps. there might be some mistakes on script(I'm not a python dev) so make sure you check all, don't forget to configure book ids correctly cuz site can accept all of your post request payloads *even practice ids* so if there is mistake you might be broke ur online book.

**this script only makes several practises and makes some of them without answers**
